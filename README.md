# ajax-wizard
Template driven Ajax API

Build an Ajax Function mostly comes with a difficult workaround and sometimes it sucks a lot until it runs. 

This circumstances inpired me to code a lightweight Ajax API. 

The benefits of Ajax Wizard is, you can write your parameters right into your HTML element, so there is no code change on further extensions. 

All you need to run Ajax Wizard is jQuery and a running PHP environment.
